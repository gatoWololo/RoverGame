Things of things that need to be done for Rover Game:
(Roughly in order of way it should be done)

1) Get rover to properly move from tile to tile while keeping track of which tile he's on.
	Probably using arrow keys from now only.
2) Figure out proper way to autogenerate tiles as the rover explores new areas.
3) Add new tile to game.
4) Implement terminal based method of control for rover.
5) Implement what tiles do and have them react with rover.
6) Implement blackness until player explores those tiles as well as fog of war concept.
7) Worry about collecting things and inventory as well as possible upgrades.
8) RTS style camera for game.

Notice we do not have to wait for certain stuff to be done before we start working on it.
The tiles can be implemented and such while the movement is figured out for rover, while
autogenerated terrain is figured out while mouse camera is figured out.
